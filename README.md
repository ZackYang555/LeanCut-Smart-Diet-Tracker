# LeanCut-Smart-Diet-Tracker
My program helps users track and balance daily nutrition to support healthy weight management.

It allows users to log meals for Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and Snacks, automatically calculates calories and macronutrients (Protein, Carbs, Fat), and provides real-time progress feedback such as “under target” or “slightly above target.”

Users can also view daily summaries or generate weekly reports that visualize energy balance and nutrition consistency.

The program is built with Flask (Python) and uses a JSON database for local data storage. It includes smart features like duplicate-meal detection, append or replace modes, calorie progress bars, and macro-nutrient charts for clear and interactive feedback.

💡 Future Vision

In the future, LeanCut could evolve into a fully intelligent nutrition assistant.

Users might simply take a photo before eating, and AI will automatically recognize the food, estimate nutrition, and suggest personalized meal adjustments based on their current diet and goals.

It could even connect with nearby restaurants, recommending specific dishes that match the user’s nutritional needs, helping people eat smarter while supporting local businesses.

The motivation behind my project was to design a tool that empowers people to take control of their diet in a simple, data-driven way — encouraging balanced nutrition and preventing obesity through everyday awareness.
